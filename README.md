### Display the current song in your menu bar

You can display your current song using [xbar](https://github.com/matryer/xbar):

![](./assets/xbar-playing.png)  
![](./assets/xbar-paused.png)

Copy [the script](./examples/xbar-now-playing.1s.py) to your plugins directory:

```sh
cp ./examples/xbar-now-playing.1s.py ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins
chmod +x ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins/xbar-now-playing.1s.py
```

Open the xbar app and you should see it appear in your menu bar!

### Dump the cover image once

This saves the cover artwork of the current song
and opens it in the Preview app.

```sh
media-control get | \
    jq -r .artworkDataBase64 | \
    base64 -d > cover && \
    open -a Preview cover

# To determine the file extension:
mv cover "cover.$(file -b cover | sed 's/ .*$//' | tr A-Z a-z)"
```

### Dump all cover images continuously during listening

Watches all changes and saves each new cover to a separate image file.

```sh
index=0; media-control stream | \
    while IFS= read -r line; do \
        if jq -e .payload.artworkDataBase64 <<< "$line" >/dev/null; then \
            jq -r .payload.artworkDataBase64 <<< "$line" | base64 -d > cover; \
            mv cover "cover-$index.$(file -b cover | sed 's/ .*$//' | tr A-Z a-z)"; \
            ((index++)); \
        fi \
    done
```

### Inspect raw data without spamming your terminal

This replaces the base64 encoded image data with `true`, if it has a value.

```sh
media-control stream | \
    while IFS= read -r line; do \
        jq 'if .payload.artworkDataBase64 != null then
            .payload.artworkDataBase64 = true
        end' <<< "$line"; \
    done
```

### Watch for song changes

This only prints whenever the song itself is changing,
i.e. either the application, song title, artist or album name.

```sh
media-control stream | \
    while IFS= read -r line; do \
        jq -r 'if .diff == false then
            "\(now | strftime("%H:%M:%S")) (\(.payload.bundleIdentifier
                )) \(.payload.title) - \(.payload.artist)"
        else
            empty
        end' <<< "$line"; \
    done
```
